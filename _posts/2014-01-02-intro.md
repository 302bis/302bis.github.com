## About me

I have over ten years experience in web development, specializing in front-end development and UX design.

As a UX designer I focus on the conception, layout and architecture of an application. I am particularly interested in the optimum arrangement of elements with regard to the type of screen (web, mobile, browser, etc.), and give priority to the usability and minimalism of a product.

My work as a front-end developer has centered around the creation of web sites and applications based on the standard HTML5 and CSS3. 

I also have experience as project manager in programs that require strong synergies between the design and development team.
