## OPI :: Open Intelligence

Open Intelligenceâ€™s mission is to pave the way for a new kind of governance, where public policies are designed for the people, by the people.

A people-centered social enterprise, we design mobile technological tools and platforms that connect leaders to citizens on the street and create personal connections on a massive scale. We have developed a targeted methodology for mass participation that extracts the collective intelligence of specific segments of the population and applies their expertise to the improvement of government strategies. Our instruments allow for the real-time processing of rich data from hundreds of thousands of participants, the production of simple visualizations, and the identification of key, actionable insights.
