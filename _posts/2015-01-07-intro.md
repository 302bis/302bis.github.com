I have over ten years experience working with web pages and webApps, specializing in UX design and front-end development. As a UX designer I focus my activity on a holistic approach combining wireframing, Information Architecture and User Centered Design. In particularly I'm obsessed with the optimum arrangement of elements with regard to the type of screen (web, mobile, browser, etc.), giving priority to the usability and minimalism of a product.

My work as a Front-End/UI developer has centered around the develop of web sites and applications based on the standard HTML5 and CSS3. Also I have experience working in projects that require strong synergies between the design and development team.
